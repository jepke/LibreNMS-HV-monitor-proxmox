# Proxmox HV Monitor Script for LibreNMS

A modular Bash script designed to feed VM and node-level metrics into **LibreNMS** via SNMP extend ‚Äî fully compatible with the **LibreNMS HV-Monitor plugin** (`hv-monitor.inc.php`).

> üì° Intended for use with LibreNMS‚Äôs `hv-monitor` SNMP extend configuration for Proxmox hosts.

---

## üîç Overview

This script queries the local Proxmox node using `pvesh`, reads `/proc` stats for VMs, and formats everything into a structured JSON block expected by **LibreNMS's Proxmox HV-Monitor module**.

It outputs to: `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.d/proxmox_hvmonitor.json`


This is the expected path used by `hv-monitor.inc.php` when added to your SNMP `extend` config.

## üß∞ Key Features

- üñ•Ô∏è Supports VM-level stats: CPU, memory, disk, network
- üìä Collects node-level totals from `/proc` and `pvesh`
- üíæ Gathers per-disk I/O via Proxmox blockstat and `/proc/diskstats`
- üåê Optional NIC metrics via QEMU Guest Agent
- üß™ Fully shell-based (no Python or Docker needed)
- üêö Verbose debug output with `--verbose` or `-V`

---

## üß™ Project Context

This was built and tested on a **small standalone Proxmox node**, with no access to a medium or production cluster. It was created as a **weekend tinkering project**, mostly for fun and learning.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not guaranteed to work out of the box on multi-node or large clusters, though it can likely be extended.

---

## üì¶ Output Format

Top-level JSON keys:

- `"hv"`: hypervisor name (e.g., `"proxmox"`)
- `"totals"`: node usage
- `"VMs"`: per-VM stats
- `"VMdisks"`: individual disk usage (not processed by hv-monitor atm)
- `"VMifs"`: reserved placeholder (not processed by hv-monitor atm)
- `"VMstatus"`: reserved placeholder (not processed by hv-monitor atm)

---

## üõ† Setup

Make sure:
- SNMP extend is configured in `snmpd.conf`
  `extend hv-monitor /usr/bin/cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.d/proxmox_hvmonitor.json`
- `jq` is installed
- Your Proxmox node can access `pvesh` and `/proc`
- QEMU Guest Agent is enabled on VMs (optional)

Run manually:
```bash
./proxmox_hv_monitor.sh
./proxmox_hv_monitor.sh --verbose
```
